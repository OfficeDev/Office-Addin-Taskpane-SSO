# Office-Addin-TaskPane-SSO

This repository contains the source code used by the [Yo Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office) when you create a new Office Add-in that appears in the task pane. You can also use this repository as a sample to base your own project from if you choose not to use the generator.

## TypeScript

This template is written using [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). For the JavaScript version of this template, go to [Office-Addin-TaskPane-SSO-JS](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Addin-TaskPane-SSO-JS).

## Instructions

- Run the following command to configure single-sign on for your add-in project.

```bash
    $ npm run configure-sso
```

- A web browser window will open and prompt you to sign in to Azure. Sign in to Azure using your Microsoft 365 administrator credentials. These credentials will be used to register a new application in Azure and configure the settings required by SSO.

- Run the following command to build the project, start the local web server, and sideload your add-in in the previously selected Office client application.

```bash
    $ npm start
```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Office Add-ins should use HTTPS, not HTTP, even when you are developing. If you are prompted to install a certificate after you run the following command, accept the prompt to install the certificate that the Yeoman generator provide.

- In the Office client application that opens when you run the previous command (i.e., Excel, Word or PowerPoint), make sure that you're signed in with a user that's a member of the same Microsoft 365 organization as the Microsoft 365 administrator account that you used to connect to Azure while configuring SSO in step 3 of the previous section. Doing so establishes the appropriate conditions for SSO to succeed.

- In the Office client application, choose the Home tab, and then choose the Show Task Pane button in the ribbon to open the add-in task pane. The following image shows this button in Excel.

- At the bottom of the task pane, choose the Get My User Profile Information button to initiate the SSO process.

    If a dialog window appears to request permissions on behalf of the add-in, this means that SSO is not supported for your scenario and the add-in has instead fallen back to an alternate method of user authentication. This may occur when the tenant administrator hasn't granted consent for the add-in to access Microsoft Graph, or when the user isn't signed into Office with a valid Microsoft account or Microsoft 365 Education or Work account. Choose the Accept button in the dialog window to continue.

- The add-in retrieves profile information for the signed-in user and writes it to the document.
